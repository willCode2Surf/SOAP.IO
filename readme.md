# SOAP.IO

A node module and server that allows more modern application stacks to connect to legacy SOAP services.

Features:

* SOAP messages marshaled as JSON
* Very clean, simple, and scalable API
* Easy interface for common SOAP operations 
* Admin panel for easy administration of SOAP endpoints
* Supports asynchronous and synchronous 
* WS-Security supported
